# Week6WarGame

This week we were instructed to create a War card playing game. We needed to create classes for: Card, Deck, Player, and a class with main method called App. This project showcases much of the work learned thus far in the Promineo Tech program and is our final Java project for this portion of the course. Enjoy!
