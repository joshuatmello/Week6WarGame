# Week6WarGame

This week we were instructed to create a War card playing game. We needed to create classes for: Card, Deck, Player, and a class with main method called App. This project showcases much of the work learned thus far in the Promineo Tech program and is our final Java project for this portion of the course. Enjoy!

Questions I have for future iterations of this project include: 
1. If the two cards are the same value how would I pull three more from each deck and then turn over the fourth? 
2. How would I create this if I added the cards to the winning playerâ€™s deck? What about if I continued the game until one of the players had no cards left? 
3. How would I make it possible to have more than two players, while not knowing how many there will be and still using Scanner(System.in)?
